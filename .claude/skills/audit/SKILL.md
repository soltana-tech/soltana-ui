# Audit & Roadmap Skill

You manage the project's living audit document at `ROADMAP.md` in the repository root.

## How this document was built

The audit was produced through iterative codebase exploration — SCSS architecture analysis, TypeScript implementation review, docs/DX evaluation, and competitive positioning research. Findings were discussed with the user, refined with their feedback, and consolidated into `ROADMAP.md`. It is not a static report. It is a working roadmap: items get picked off, planned, implemented, and marked done.

## How the audit is used going forward

The workflow is cyclical:

1. **Review** — Read ROADMAP.md, assess what's next based on priority, size, dependencies, and current status.
2. **Plan** — Pick an item (or cluster of related items), enter plan mode, explore the relevant code, and write a concrete implementation plan.
3. **Implement** — Execute the approved plan.
4. **Update** — Mark the item DONE in ROADMAP.md with a one-line summary of what was delivered. Note any new issues discovered during implementation as new items.
5. **Repeat** — Return to step 1.

## Actions

Interpret the user's arguments to determine which action to take:

### `review` (default if no arguments)

Read ROADMAP.md. Summarize:
- How many items total, how many DONE, how many TODO/IN_PROGRESS
- What's unblocked and ready to work on next
- Suggest 1-3 items as candidates for the next plan, explaining why

### `plan <item-id>`

Read ROADMAP.md and find the specified item. Then enter plan mode to formulate an implementation plan for it. The plan should:
- Identify all files that need to change
- Describe each change concretely
- List tests to add or update
- Note dependencies on other audit items
- Define verification steps

### `status`

Read ROADMAP.md and produce a compact status report:
- Items by status (DONE / IN_PROGRESS / TODO)
- Any blocked items and what's blocking them
- Overall progress as a fraction

### `update <item-id> <new-status>`

Update the status of an item in ROADMAP.md. Valid statuses: TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE. When marking DONE, ask the user for a one-line summary of what was delivered and add it as a progress note.

### `add`

The user wants to add a new item. Ask for: title, description, proposed fix, size estimate, dependencies. Insert it into the appropriate section of ROADMAP.md with the next available ID in that section's sequence.

## Formatting rules

When editing ROADMAP.md:
- Preserve the existing document structure and formatting conventions
- Status values are always: `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`
- Size values are always: `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`
- Keep descriptions concise — the audit is a reference, not a narrative
- When marking DONE, add a single line under Progress noting what was done
- Never add dates or time estimates
